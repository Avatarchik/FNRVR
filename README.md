# FNRVR

This project shows the basic steps to setting up VR with [Forge Networking Remasterd](https://github.com/BeardedManStudios/ForgeNetworkingRemastered).

To test the project simply host on one computer with a VR headset, and connect with another computer with a VR headset.  You will be able to a representation of eachother sent across the network.  To test locally you can turn off VR support before building, then turn in back on in the editor, allowing you to see the editor player moving around.

If you need any help stop by the [Forge Discord server](https://discord.gg/yzZwEYm) and message me @mcguinnessdr.  If you find any issues, go ahead and create an issue here, or if you have a fix just create a pull request.
